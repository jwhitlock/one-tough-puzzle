# One Tough Puzzle Solver

One Tough Puzzleâ„¢ (2003, Great American Puzzle Factory) is a 9-piece
cardboard puzzle, red on one side, black on the other, with two tabs
and two blanks that look like playing card suits. I've played it for
a bit and wanted to see it solved. There's several solutions online,
but I wanted to try solving it with Python before I look at them.
I'm also playing with mypy and typing.
